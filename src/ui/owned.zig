//! Heap-allocated state types shared between `state.zig` and the
//! per-domain modules under `actions/`.
//!
//! Background: most of the UI's long-lived state — caches, in-flight
//! jobs, running-game tables — is heap-allocated by the action modules
//! and parked through a slot on `state.State` until the next frame
//! drains it. The "right" home for those types is alongside their
//! lifecycle (`actions/*.zig`), but `state.zig` is imported by the
//! action modules so having `state.zig` import the concrete types
//! back would close a cycle. The previous workaround was to declare
//! every slot as `?*anyopaque` and pay one `@ptrCast(@alignCast)` per
//! read.
//!
//! `owned.zig` breaks the cycle: it owns the *data* shape of each
//! type, imports only modules that don't pull `state`/`actions`, and
//! is consumed by both. Behavior (workers, drain helpers, lifecycle)
//! stays under `actions/`, operating on `*owned.SyncJob` etc.
//!
//! R4 lands these incrementally. Each phase keeps the build + tests
//! green:
//!   R4a — primitive-valued maps/sets (this file's first cut)
//!   R4b — caches (ModfileCache, ModsPageCache, …)
//!   R4c — jobs (SyncJob, UpdateCheckJob, …)
//!   R4d — modal/transient (ClashModalState, …)
