//! Generic worker-job primitive.
//!
//! Every UI feature that offloads work to a detached thread followed
//! the same shape:
//!   1. heap-alloc a struct with `phase: atomic.Value(u8)`, `thr`,
//!      `alloc`, `win`, plus payload-specific fields;
//!   2. spawn a worker thread that flips `phase` on terminal state +
//!      calls `dvui.refresh(win, …)` to wake the UI;
//!   3. each frame, drain the slot: if `phase == .pending` return;
//!      otherwise branch on `.done` / `.failed`, run a cleanup, free.
//!
//! Twelve+ jobs hand-rolled that scaffolding. `Job(Payload)` captures
//! the common shape; `spawnJob` factors the alloc + spawn + detach +
//! slot-set chain; `drainBackgroundJob` factors the per-frame reap.
//! New workers reduce to: define a `Payload` struct, write
//! `myWorker(job: *Job(Payload)) void`, call `spawnJob`, and
//! `drainBackgroundJob(...onDone, ...onFailed)` once per frame.
//!
//! Per-job phase enums (`SyncJobPhase`, `RefreshTagsPhase`, …) all
//! used the canonical pending/done/failed shape so this primitive
//! standardises on `Job.Phase`.
